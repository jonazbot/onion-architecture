# Booster workshop: The onion architecture

This is the code we will be working on in the workshop. [Fork it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and let's get going!

## Working with the code

This repo contains a java/maven application. You can either work with it on your own computer, or you can use GitHub Codespaces.

### On your own computer

1. [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Install an IDE. I recommend [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
3. Install java, if you haven't got it already. [This can be done from the IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html).
4. Run the main method in the class named `App`.

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the **Code** drop-down menu.
2. Click on the **Codespaces** tab.
3. Click **Create codespace on main**.
